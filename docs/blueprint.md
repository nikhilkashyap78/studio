# **App Name**: Memento Mori Calendar

## Core Features:

- Age and Lifespan Input: Allow users to input their current age and expected lifespan in years.
- Calendar Generation: Generate a grid representing weeks lived and weeks remaining based on user input.
- Visual Differentiation: Clearly distinguish between weeks already lived (filled) and weeks remaining (empty) within the grid.
- Mortality Reminder: Display a subtle, impactful label: 'Every box is one week you’ll never get back.'
- Screenshot Ready Output: Create output optimized for sharing and virality, including correct meta tags and accessibility support.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, saturated purple (#4E0449) to evoke thoughtfulness.
- Background color: Light grayish-purple (#E6E2E5) with approximately the same hue as the primary, offering subtle contrast.
- Accent color: A magenta color (#C71A85) to highlight remaining weeks.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif for a neutral look.
- Minimalist grid layout to clearly represent each week of life. The grid should adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining its impact.
- A subtle animation on page load and/or upon entering user details. Consider a fade-in or grow effect of filled in boxes. Animation should only occur one time.
